# Nueral-Networks-Charity-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the success of organizations that have been funded by Alphabet

## Summary

The models accuracy ended up being 72.3%. I started with a data set and tried to predict whether or not the project would be successful on all of the features used after dropping two features that we were irrelevant. Although we did not achieve the desired accuracy of 75%, it is possible that the reason for this is we may have had to drop more features which may have affected how good the neural network actually is.
