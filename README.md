# Nueral-Networks-Charity-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the success of organizations that have been funded by Alphabet

## Summary

The models accuracy ended up being 72.3% - we started with a data set and tried to predict whether or not the project would be successful on all of the features that we used after dropping two features that we figured to be irrelevant. Although this did not get to the accuracy of 75% desired, it is possible the reason for this is we may have had to drop more features which may have affected how good the neural network actually is.
